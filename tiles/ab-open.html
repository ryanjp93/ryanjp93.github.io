		The goal of this project was to create an agent capable of automatically playing and completing the popular phone game "Angry Birds" which could optionally be entered into an
		anual competition. Each entrant is provided with a game playing library programmed using Java which reads in colour data from the screen and uses it to determine important
		information for solving the level such as the position of the pigs, the number of birds and the positions and types of obstacles. A successful agent needs to be able to interpret
	        this data and determine the best course of action, or at the very least avoid endless behaviour loops. An effective agent would need to go a step further and have some degree
		of learning, building up its own idea of what constitutes a good shot.

		This project was straightforward from a programming perspective as most of the necessary classes were supplied in the AIBIRDS library. The difficulty of the project instead
		came from building up the logic that would allow the agent to solve the levels. A good agent was one which would learn as it played, taking knowledge gained from the current
		level into the next one until it could eventually solve levels with next to no failures. In my first attempt I had the agent simply log any shots which were deemed good (determined
	        simply by whether it landed a hit within the next two shots) and prioritise those, however this fell apart once the obstacles became more complex. The next attempt introduced a
	       	chaos system where when no pigs were available to be hit, it would instead aim to destroy the obstacle that would leave the biggest impact on the level, since pigs could also be 
		hit from falling structures. Additionally, further improvements were made such as having the agent ignore any obstacles which were unbreakable. However, because this solution relied
		entirely on long term memory, it led to a problem where the agent would build up a very unfavourable impression of certain shots which would actually be the only single solution to 
		some levels, resulting in a failure loop. This failure loop would then skew future data by logging good shots as bad and bad shots as good. The final iteration therefore added a 
		short term memory system to adjust to individual levels. It would also avoid logging outlying data to the long term memory to prevent the skewing of future level attempts.

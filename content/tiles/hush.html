		Hush is a 2D stealth platformer created in C# using Microsoft's now deprecated XNA framework, it is the most "complete" game project on this website owing to a competent and stable team. 
		Despite being one of my older projects, the game has several noteworthy features such as stealth AI mechanics, a level editor, branching paths and acrobatic player movement. 
		The game is actually built using a custom made game engine, which sits on top of XNA, developed during the course of the project which allows for straightforward "drag and drop" level creation.

		Fundamentally, the objective of the game is to get from the entrance of the level to one of the exits. Depending on the exit, they are placed in a different level where this objective resets. The 
		player has access to a wide variety of acrobatic moves to assist them in this: jump, double jump, wall kick, ledge grab, crawl, sprint, roll, throw knife and perform a silent takedown (if unseen
		and behind an enemy). This variety is important because it prevents the stealth mechanics from causing the game to drag and allows the player to be creative in how they play. Some actions such as
	        throwing knives and takedowns require consumable items which can be purchased from vending machines scattered throughout the levels. The main obstacle to the player reaching the exit is the enemies.
		There are three primary types of enemies, each of which have different artificial intelligence. Humanoid enemies will move towards sounds as they hear them, sound an alarm if alerted and chase the
		player on sight. Should they lose sight of the player, they will move to their last known location. Turret enemies keep their sights trained on the player once spotted and perform an instant kill
		should the player fail to break their line of sight. Finally, camera enemies sound an alarm should the player walk into their sensors.

		<span class="bold">The Level Editor</span>
		Creating a custom game engine was the primary focus of the first half of the project, the idea being that a competent level editor will make creating the actual game content straightforward. The
		engine is able to read in a black and white image (collision map) and use it to determine where the player is and isn't allowed to move. This is useful because a level can be created simply by
		taking a background image, blacking out the walls and out of bounds parts and then dropping it in the level folder. By loading this background and collision map combination in the level editor,
	       	the user is able to drop game elements such as enemies, doors and vendors on to the screen and link the level to other levels.

		The team experience for this game was the complete opposite of the experience mentioned in the "Multiplayer FP Shooter" project. The team worked well together, the project was well organised
		and individual skill levels and motivation were both high. Additionally, the decision to create a game making engine as opposed to a game for the first few months paid off immensely when it
		reached a point where we could create new content for the game by simpling handing the engine a black and white collision map, picking a level background and then dragging and dropping enemies
		and obstacles onto it. While some features still did not make it into the game, most notably a storyline, from a mechanics perspective the game was sound.

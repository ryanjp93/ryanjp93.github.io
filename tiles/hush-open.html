		This game, named Hush, is a 2D stealth platformer created in C# using Microsoft's now deprecated XNA framework, it is the most "complete" game project on this website. Despite being an older
		project, the game has several noteworthy features such as stealth AI mechanics, a level editor, branching paths, item vendors and acrobatic player movement. The game is actually built using
		a custom made game engine, which sits on top of XNA, developed during the course of the project which allows for straightforward "drag and drop" level creation.

		The team experience for this game was the complete opposite of the experience mentioned in the "Multiplayer FP Shooter" project. The team worked well together, the project was well organised
		and individual skill levels and motivation were both high. Additionally, the decision to create a game making engine as opposed to a game for the first few months paid off immensely when it
		reached a point that we could create new content for the game by simpling handing the engine a black and white collision map, picking a level background and then dragging and dropping enemies
		and obstacles onto it. While some features still did not make it into the game, most notably a storyline, from a mechanics perspective the game was sound.

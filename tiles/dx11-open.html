		This project attempts to create a render core capable of rendering scenes with a variety of impressive graphical effects, most notably using shaders, in a way that allows for minimal
		effort in adding new objects and effects to a scene. The core is programmed in C++ using Microsoft's DirectX11 SDK and the shaders are programmed in High-Level Shader Language (HLSL).
		The core contains a number of generic shaders for effects such as reflections, bump mapping and lighting and also some more impressive specific shaders for effects such as skyboxes, terrain
		generation and water. While these shaders make up the majority of the project focus, a great deal of time was also invested in decoupling the core as much as possible to offer a more modular
		design where adding a new effect is as simple as dropping in a shader file and linking the parts of the core that it requires.

		Prior to working on this project I had already worked on two rendering cores in C++ with DirectX9 as part of university and another in JavaScript with WebGL while on work placement.
		Despite those experiences, 3D programming had never really "clicked" with me and I did not find it particularly fun to work with. This changed however with this core, with shaders in
		particular becoming an area of interest to me. Although this was a university project, most of my work on the core itself was not required as part of the course and was not worth extra
		credit. I did it purely out of a personal interest in learning how to make a render core from scratch, starting with a completely blank project and taking time to consider how it should be
		structured. The main difficulties of this project were in the binding of shader resources and finding alternatives to deprecated DirectX tools.

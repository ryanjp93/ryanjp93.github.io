		The original Phillips Machine, or Monetary National Income Analogue Computer (MONIAC), was a hydraulic representation of cash flow within the UK economy in the early 20th
		century. The machine was used to represent the circular flow of income, shown by the economic equation Aggregate Demand = Consumer Expenditure + Investment + Government
		Spending + (Exports - Imports), or Y = C + I + G + (X - M), which is an important equation in determining an economy\'s output. While these machines were originally
		restricted to military and government use, with the rise of digital computing and fall of Keynesian Economics, they no longer see use outside of museums and universities.
		The basic flow of the original machine is that water (cash) enter at the top of the machine (as income), where it flows downward through the various pipes and tanks (sectors
		of the economy) until it arrives at the bottom (as national output) and is pumped back to the top of the machine (completing the circular flow). The machine uses
		a complicated system of strings, weights and pulleys to enable a user to manipulate this model with economic factors such as interest rates and taxes to see how the
		economy would be affected as a whole. As a dissertation, the aim of this project was to digitally reproduce the original, with as many of the original features as possible.

		<span class="bold">Overview<br></span>
		The project is programmed in C# and split into three main parts: the GUI part, the graphics part and the unit tests. In addition to the standard C# libraries, the GUI part
		uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the graphics part uses the SharpDX Toolkit. While each of these parts generally work seperately, the GUI hosts the simulation's
		window, which can be considered the output of the graphics part. In order to make this interaction simpler, the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) design pattern is used to keep the
		two as seperate as possible outside of the window hosting.

		I originally decided on this topic for my dissertation because it offered me the chance to combine economics, which was my favourite subject at A Level, and programming, which was
		my university focus. Understanding the original machine and planning how to adapt each part, such as the water flow, would make up the majority of this project's difficulty.

		The project was well received, winning a "Best Overall Performance" award and being one of twelve dissertations published to the University of Huddersfield's 2016 Fields
		journal. This can be downloaded <a class="downloadLink" href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/26730/" target="_blank">here</a> and contains more detail on the project, an installer for

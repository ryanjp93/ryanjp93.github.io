		This project attempts to create a render core capable of creating scenes with a variety of impressive graphical effects, most notably using shaders. The core is programmed in C++ using 
		Microsoft's DirectX11 SDK and the shaders are programmed in High-Level Shader Language (HLSL). The core contains a number of generic shaders for effects such as reflections, bump mapping 
		and lighting. It also contains some more impressive specific shaders for effects such as skyboxes, terrain generation and water. While these shaders make up the majority of the project
		focus, a great deal of time was also invested in decoupling the core as much as possible to offer a more modular design where adding a new effect is as simple as dropping in a shader file
		and linking the parts of the core that it requires.

		- <span class="bold">Skybox</span>: A textured cube which is always drawn behind everything else in the world, creating the illusion of sky. Achieved by disabling the z bugger and culling for the
		object.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Lighting</span>: Fairly standard stuff- uses ambient, diffuse and specular to highlight and shade parts of an object to better represent their shape. See the water tile
		for a breakdown of the more complicated lighting that occurs on the water.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Environment/reflection mapping</span>: Takes the point of view and line of sight to a point on an object. The angle at which this line intersects the object is calculated
		to determine the point on the environment (i.e. the skybox) which should be shown on the original object.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Bump/normal mapping</span>: A texture containing new surface normals for an object is used when calculating lighting and reflections to give in the impression of "bumps"
		or detail on an object. In reality it is just a trick of the lights and no vertex manipulation occurs.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Terrain generation</span>: Similar to bump mapping in the way it works. However, the texture (known as a height map) is used to offset vertices rather than calculate lighting.

		Prior to working on this project I had already worked on two rendering cores in C++ with DirectX9 as part of university and another in JavaScript with WebGL while on work placement. This core,
		however, is completely unrelated to both of those. Although this was a university project, most of my work on the core itself was not required as part of the course and not worth extra
		credit. I did it purely out of a personal interest in learning how to make a render core from scratch, starting with a completely blank project and taking time to consider how it should be
		structured. The main difficulties for this project were in the binding of shader resources and finding alternatives to deprecated DirectX tools.

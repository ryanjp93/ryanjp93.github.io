		This tile discusses the year I worked at DriveWorks Ltd. in Warrington as a Junior Developer, primarily using web technologies. When I first started at DriveWorks I was given a full month of web development
		training by the other developers, this covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET, MVC, Razor and Knockout. Once completed, I contributed directly to the release of DriveWorks 11
		and later a new experimental web product dubbed "Atlas".

		DriveWorks at the time developed two main pieces of software: the DriveWorks plugin for the SolidWorks CAD software and a separate stand-alone extension of this product known simply as DriveWorks
	       	(version 11 and later 12). DriveWorks allows a user to automate the design of products which will fundamentally function the same and therefore save time on recreating these same designs, with 
		further configuration it allows the user to also automate extra steps such as invoice and e-mail creation. The main DriveWorks software has a back-end part programmed in C# (new) and VB (old) 
		and a front-end part programming in TypeScript (new) and JavaScript (old). Initially the company source controlled its software using TFS, though towards the end the company was switching over 
		to Git. While using TFS the company followed the Agile development process, with bi-weekly sprints and daily stand-up meetings as it fit well with the TFS work item and code review systems.

		My first task after completing my training was to create several small widgets (named controls) for the web application, the main two being a calendar and a file uploader, this entailed writing the 
		functionality in JavaScript, hooking it up to the C# back-end and styling it using HTML and CSS. Each of these controls were required to have a "standard" skin and a "metro" skin and had to support 
		Internet Explorer (7 and up), Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. Later in the release cycle I was tasked with porting numerous existing JavaScript controls to TypeScript, as the company was making a
		shift towards it at the time. These tasks were considerably complicated by the fact that the DriveWorks codebase was on its eleventh iteration and many of the original developers had left the company. 
		At the very end of the release cycle, I spent several weeks working on high priority feature requests from customers, testing the software and bug fixing. For the final part of my time at DriveWorks
		I was given the chance to work on a completely new product, with fresh code and a new method of source control. This product was named "Atlas" during development and aimed to be a modern single page
	        application which functioned in a manner similar to Microsoft's OneDrive. Unlike the main DriveWorks software it would not aim to support Internet Explorer 7, 8 or 9. Dropping support for 7 drastically
		simplified everything from the styling to the functionality, as it typically requires workarounds at all levels, and dropping 8 and 9 drastically simplified the CSS as, among others, it meant the use
		of flexbox was permitted. While working on the Atlas project I was given three main tasks: to assist work on a WebGL based model renderer due to my experience in graphics programming, to create a web
		based file directory similar to DropBox and OneDrive, and finally to programmatically generate interactive SVG line and pie charts for use with a new analytics feature.

		My time at DriveWorks was a bit of a struggle for the most part as I had never worked in web development before and on day one I was told I would be trained to do it. While I did take to the core 
		training quickly, I found the sheer number of tools and catches (particularly between browsers) to be incredibly confusing. Over time though my contributions became better though and I started to
		be trusted with more important work.

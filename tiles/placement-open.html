		This tile discusses the year I worked at DriveWorks Ltd. as a Junior Developer primarily using web technologies. DriveWorks at the time developed two main pieces of software, the DriveWorks plugin for
		the SolidWorks CAD software and a standalone extension of this product known as DriveWorks 11 (later 12). DriveWorks allows a user to automate the design of products which will fundamentally function
		the same and therefore save time on recreating these same designs, with further configuration it allows the user to also automate extra steps such as invoice and e-mail creation. The main DriveWorks
		software has a desktop part programmed in C# and VB and a web part programmed using JavaScript and TypeScript. Initially the company source controlled its software using TFS, though towards the end the
		company was switching over to Git. While using TFS the company followed the Agile development process, with bi-weekly sprints and daily standup meetings as it fit well with the TFS work item and code
		review systems.

		When I first began working at DriveWorks I was given a full month of web training by the other developers. This training covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET, MVC, Razor and Knockout, as they would
		be my primary tools for the first three or four months. During this time I contributed to the DriveWorks 11 release, creating new widgets (named controls in this case) for the web application and later
		porting existing JavaScript controls to use TypeScript. The complexity of this task was due to each control having a client side and server side version and using MVC extensively, which I had limited experience
		with at the time. Additionally, the web application had a classic theme and a metro theme, meaning that every control was required to have two very different skins and needed to support all browsers Internet
		Explorer 7 and up. These tasks were further complicated by the fact that the DriveWorks codebase was eleven iterations in the making and therefore very large, meaning it took time for me to grasp it. Leading up
		to the DriveWorks 11 release I worked on high priorty feature requests from the customers and later testing the software and reporting bugs in TFS, which occasionally also led to me fixing them myself when I had
		the skills to do so. In my final months at DriveWorks I was given the chance to work on a completely new product, named "Atlas" during development. This product aimed to be a modern single page application which
		functioned similarly to Microsoft's OneDrive. Unlike the main software it dropped support for older browsers such as Internet explorer 7, 8 and 9 which drastically simplified the web development process. I
		was given three primary tasks during these final months: to assist work on a WebGL based model renderer due to my experience with graphics programming, to create a web based file directory similar to Dropbox
		and OneDrive, and finally to learn to programmatically generate interactive SVG line and pie charts.

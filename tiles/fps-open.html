		This project aimed to create a fast paced multiplayer first person shooting game using C# in the Unity engine. Unity's networking tools are also used to ensure that the game is
		simple to connect to and disconnect from similar to many Valve shooters, which was prioritised to encourage people to try it out. In terms of art design, the game uses an exaggerated
		cartoony style which contrasts with the excessively gory gameplay. It was worked on by four designers and four programmers, though these numbers eventually dropped to three and three.

		The project experienced many management problems common with university group projects such as over scoping, poorly nailed down mechanics and both the lead designer and lead programmer 
		quitting university early. Furthermore, there was a gap in individual skill and motivation between the programmers which means that the quality of features varies greatly. Further still, 
		the design team experienced even more mismanagement which left the already inconsistent art and assets in a place between incomplete and alpha level. Despite this, the team was able to
	       	pull together and deliver a game which, while unpolished and incomplete, has most of the complicated systems such as networking, leaderboards, respawns and round management in place. 
		All in, the project was a bit of a nightmare and the networking didn't make things any easier, but it was a learning experience, especially in being able to see alternate ways to
	       	handle clients and servers outside of web programming.

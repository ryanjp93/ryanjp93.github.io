		This project aimed to create a fast paced multiplayer first person shooting game using C# in the Unity engine. An important design aspect for the game was to have it easy to pick up
		and play, similar to a Valve shooter, it utilizes Unity's Networking API for this purpose. In terms of art design, the game uses an exaggerated cartoony style which contrasts with 
		the excessively gory gameplay. It was worked on by four programmers and four designers, though these numbers eventually dropped to two and two.

		The project experienced many management problems common to university group projects such as over scoping and poorly nailed down mechanics. Additionally, both the lead designer and lead
	       	programmer dropped out of university and there was a large gap in individual skill and motivation levels which meant that the quality of art and features vary greatly. Further still, 
		the design team experienced even more mismanagement which left the already inconsistent art and assets in a place between incomplete and alpha level. Despite this, the team was able to
	       	pull together and deliver a game which, while unpolished and incomplete, has most of the complicated systems such as networking, leaderboards, respawns and round management in place. 
		In all, the project was a bit of a nightmare and the networking didn't make things any easier, but it was a learning experience. When the lead programmer and sole person capable of network 
		programming in Unity left, I was able to apply my knowledge of web servers to pick up the pieces.

		This website was originally created as a means of practising modern web design, in particular responsive design. Its design was heavily influenced by the metro style which
		was popular at the time. The site was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and targeted most modern browsers, resolutions and devices. It used purely native functionality
		such as media queries to achieve its responsiveness, with no browser sniffing or hacks. Although the new version of the site was built from scratch, a few elements of this
	       	original site influenced the design.

		The site is made up of two main views, the widescreen view which hosts the navigation panel on the left hand side of the screen, and the narrow view which moves it to the top.
		Moving the navigation to the top on mobiles allows more space for the content and makes it easier to condense the page. The other main area of focus in the responsive design
		is the tiles. The tiles grow to fill available space on mobile screens and resize themselves to allow multiple per row on medium screens. While the tiles were eventually reused
		in the newer site design, they are implemented differently. At the time they were floated elements, but this has been replaced with flexbox as it became more widely supported.
		The main reasons for this being that floated elements tend to cause positioning issues and performance hits.

		As previously mentioned, I originally created the website to practice modern web design as with most of my previous web projects I was either working on a specific feature which
	       	did not prioritise design elements or I was developing with older browsers such as Internet Explorer 7 and 8 in mind, which is highly limiting. Needless to say the responsive 
		design, particularly with the tiles, was the most difficult part of this project.

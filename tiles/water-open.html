		The aim of this project was to produce realistic looking water using the High-Level Shader Language (HLSL).<br>
		<br>
		Below is a breakdown of how it is created (images correspond with each step number):<br>
		1) Before the program is run, the water is a flat colourless plane.<br>
		2) The plane is given a colour which ranges between dark blue (deep waves) and light blue (shallow waves). However, the wave at this point is still flat.<br>
		3) Two Gerstner Waves are combined and used to displace the plane's vertices, which causes it to move in a manner similar to real water.<br>
		4) Using the newly generated normals from the vertex displacement, a reflection is applied on the water from the skybox around it.<br>
		5) Lighting is taken into account and in this case that is in the form of the moon which circles around the ocean in the sky, causing shadows and lit areas.<br>
		6) Refraction and Fresnel reflection equations are applied to the final water colours to make the water react with lighting and reflections in a more natural way.<br>
		7) Finally, High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) lighting is applied by reading hidden values stored in the skybox texture.<br>
		8/9) Because the water colours are generated dynamically from the skybox, if the skybox is changed then the water colour adjusts to it automatically.

		This project became quite the learning experience as I rewrote the shader entirely at least five times before I was pleased with the water's appearance. The biggest problem encountered 
		on this project was with the maths. Learning to think with respect to 3x3 matrices and calculating how a reflection is affected by the position and direction of the viewer and then by
	       	a normal value from an object and soon made every step of this project hard. However, because I spent so long researching shader concepts, since completing this project I have found
	       	shaders to be fairly fun and straightforward to work with.

		This render core is created using C++ with Microsoft's DirectX9 SDK. It features a number of effects which are considered dated by today's standards but visually impressive regardless.
		This is the oldest project on this site and is improved on in every aspect by the DirectX11 Render Core.

		- <span class="bold">Lighting</span>: The environment is lit using a directional light which hits the ground at an angle to simulate the sun. This light is also responsible for casting the main
		shadows in the scene. There is also a point light which follows the player around and is orange in colour, aiming to simulate a lantern. Finally, there is a plane flying around in the sky which
		shoots a spotlight at the ground from below it.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Skybox</span>: A textured cube which is always drawn behind everything else in the world, creating the illusion of sky. Achieved by disabling the z bugger and culling for the
		object.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Particle effects</span>: It is possible to turn on rain or snow weather effects in the options. These work by creating hundreds of small objects (particles) which move around
		- <span class="bold">Collision detection</span>: Using a technique called ray casting, the first person camera checks for collisions with objects and walls and
		prevents the player from walking through them. The terrain the player walks on has a number of hills and slopes, rays are continually cast downwards to keep the player walking inline
		with the terrain (as opposed to falling through it or hovering over it).<br/>
		through the sky. Each mapped with a simple texture which is white for snow and blue for rain. Snow will typically move randomly (except upwards), whereas rain will always move downwards at an angle.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Alpha transparency</span>: Uses alpha blending and testing to correctly render the leaves on the trees (which are flat textures) without causing clipping issues.<br/>
		- <span class="bold">Render quality</span>: The core utilizes anti-aliasing and texture filtering to smooth the edges of objects in the scene.<br/>

		This project looks like it could be part of a game released ten years ago, which is not bad considering it was used to help me get to grips with graphics programming and 3D maths.

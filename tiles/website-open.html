		This website was originally created as a means of practicing modern web design, in particular responsive design. It was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and targeted
		most modern browsers, resolutions and devices. The site used purely native functionality such as media queries to achieve its responsiveness. Rather than targeting specific
		devices it used media queries as thresholds where content would expand to fill available space. In trying to target both phones and desktops, which sit on completely opposite 
		ends of the screen size scale, the site design also shifts between a portrait and landscape layout as phones typically have more vertical space than horizontal space, while
		desktop monitors are the opposite. Although the new version of the site was built from scratch, a few elements of this original site such as the tiling were taken into account.

		The website was originally intended to be a single page application which would request its content from a server using Node.js and Express.js. However, once the website began to
		take shape, I removed the server side and converted it into an online portfolio because I thought that the SPA and responsive design elements would fit this purpose. As previously
		mentioned, I originally created the website to practice modern web design as with most of my previous web projects I was either working on a specific feature which did not prioritise
		design elements or I was developing with older browsers such as Internet Explorer 7 and 8 in mind, which is highly limiting. Needless to say the responsive design, particularly with
		the tiles, was the most difficult part of this project.
